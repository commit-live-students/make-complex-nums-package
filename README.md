Note: You are not allowed to use any internal class called `complex`

Define a class called `complex_number` which accepts 2 parameters:

* x: int64, float64, real component of the complex numbers
* y: int64, float64, imaginary component of the complex number

The number can exist in 2 formats:

* rectangular (cartesian)
* polar

Define the follwoing operations for the class: (these methods should be compatible with `int` and `float` datatypes as well)

* representation
* '+'
* '-'
* '*'
* '/'
* '+='
* '-='
* '*='
* '/='
* '-' (e.g. a = 5, then -a should return -5)
* abs()

Also, define following methods.

* to_polar()
* to_rectangular()
* argument()
* conjugate()

Include error handling

Optional: Make the package pip installable.
